Hey there! this is a read me for my website. 


I'm a student at the tech academy and I'm learning HTML, CSS and many other languages at the moment. This website was the final project of the HTML/CSS Unit.
Thank you so much for checking out my webpage portfolio, and I hope we can work together in the future! 

Best wishes, 

-Raleigh.
